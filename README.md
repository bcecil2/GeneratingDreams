# GeneratingDreams
*"I wish to paint in such a manner as if I were photographing dreams." - Zdzisław Beksiński*

Beksinski's work ranges from the haunting to beautiful and while his art progressed 
over the years certain themes and patterns strike the viewer. Because of this I hoped
that a GAN might be able to pick up on these patterns and generate images in his style.
A complete archive of his work was downloaded from [here](https://www.wikiart.org/en/zdzislaw-beksinski/all-works/text-list).
In machine learning terms this is quite a small dataset (700 photos) so the models struggled.
